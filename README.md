# CodeBuilder

Compile time code generation made simple.

 - **Intuitive and powerul API**: Use an API buildt around the Builder pattern and immutable objects to generate 
 complex code quickly and safely.
 - **Strings are not required**: CodeBuilder includes a powerful resolver engine which automatically generates names
  and ensures consistency and formatting across the generated code.

You can try it out by adding this dependency to your annotation processor module:

```groovy
compile 'com.github.wrdlbrnft:code-builder:0.1.0.0'
